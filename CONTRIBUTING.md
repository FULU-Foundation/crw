## Issue Trackers

Consumer Rights Wiki uses two separate issue trackers for different purposes:

- [consumer-rights-wiki](https://github.com/Consumer-Rights-Wiki-Org/wiki) – For code-related issues and technical discussions.
- [consumer-rights-wiki-issues](https://github.com/Consumer-Rights-Wiki-Org/wiki-issues/issues) – For non-code issues, content suggestions, and feature requests.

These trackers are combined into a shared [GitHub project view](https://github.com/orgs/Consumer-Rights-Wiki-Org/projects/1).

## I Have a Question

> Please check the available [documentation](https://github.com/Consumer-Rights-Wiki-Org/wiki/wiki) before opening a question.

Before asking a question, search the [issue trackers](#issue-trackers) to see if your question has already been answered. If you find a relevant issue but still need clarification, feel free to comment on it.

If you still need help:

- Open an issue in the appropriate [issue tracker](#issue-trackers).
- Provide as much context as possible.
- Please make sure to use the `question` tag.

We'll do our best to get back to you quickly.

  - OS and platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, x86, ARM)
  - Version of runtime/compiler/environment
  - Inputs and expected vs actual outputs
  - Clear reproduction steps

To submit a bug:

- Open an issue in the appropriate [issue tracker](#issue-trackers).
- Describe expected and actual behavior.
- Provide full context and reproduction steps (including code if possible).
- Include the details from the checklist above.

After submission:

- A team member will triage your report.
- If reproduction steps are unclear, we'll tag it `needs-repro` and request more info.
- Once confirmed, it will be marked `needs-fix` or other relevant labels, and left open for implementation.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This includes ideas for new features or improvements to existing ones.
